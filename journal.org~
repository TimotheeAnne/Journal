**** the joy of Ross
***** issue with the free_fait joint traectory   
I have converted one succesfull trajectory into a yaml file, 
I also change the initialization of the robot in ROS to the same as in pybullet
At the init there is an error with bad state, after la,ch is work for 1s then another error and at the end the robot did nit get up.
it gives the error:

the error came from the angularVelocityBase limit at 4. in RocoState.cpp  by putting 5. it works.

**** plan to do 
The main issue of my last internship was the difficulty t learn a useful model

**** for the hard smoothing 
its better to start with only one random because the the samplingdunamics is farther from the purely random one

**** walking forward 
with a in [-1,1] and hard smoothing condition it does not succed to walk wthout falling or just stay there but not falling, it lean forward then fall
by reducing to [-0.5,0.5] it succeed to walk forward

** February  
*** Week 3-7
**** TODO [100%]
***** DONE pass the hard sampling on GPU
2 times 
***** DONE see why the distance showed is not the one plot
in the print distance there was a wrong indexation of the sample (which is always of shape (1, episode length, obs dim)
***** DONE make it walks up to 1m/s with hard smoothing
only succeeded to reach 0.4m/s while reducing the smoothing
***** DONE see the effect of qref and delta qref as actions
[[/home/timothee/Documents/Journal/Video and figures/february/7_02/joint_VS_delta_joint.png][distance]] median + each 20 runs 
***** DONE add soft smoothing
***** DONE see if changing the control frequency improve something
for 25Hz its seems messy, need more fine tuning of action space or pid gain
***** DONE Add jerk smoothing
***** DONE see Horizon X best speed/reward
***** DONE see Max speed x Vel Acc Jerk limit
***** DONE test with different frictions
it works for mismatches -0.5, 0, 0.5 eg friction 0.5, 1, 2
***** DONE test meta-learning
it works for different frictions 
**** 3
***** increase the qref limit
increasing the limit to [-0.8,0.8] and reducing the xreward weight to 0.005 allow the robot to walk forward but always at speed 0.2m/s 
***** increase the episode length
it converges in less than 50 random + 50 MPC (giving >50 MPC does not five anything)
***** increase the maximal action velocity and acceleration
increasing those values increases the maximal velocity of the robot
***** increase the horizon
from 10 to 20 reduce a bit the maximal speed of the robot
***** decreease the control frequency
it's worse (require different fine-tuning)
**** 4
***** using swing & extention action parameters
it does not change much the same celocity is reach when hard smoothing 
***** collect data on the trotting gait example of simToReal

***** small proof of Vqref anfd Aqref
V has to be smaller than A so that the bou,ded actin space does not create issue with amax=amin

[[/home/timothee/Documents/Journal/Video and figures/february/14_02/torque_basic_horizon.png][fig]] H=25 seems better, after the performance decreases

with better limit the robot does not fall but we can see that it is blocked in a local minima where it lean forward
even with only the x and z reward it gets stucks in leaning forward:
- the horizon may be too small: 25=0.1s
- the max_torque_jerk may be too small
